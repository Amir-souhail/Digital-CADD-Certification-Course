# Sheet Metal Tutorial 5 – SOLIDWORKS Design Project

## 📄 Overview

This repository contains a SOLIDWORKS sheet metal tutorial model titled **"Sheet Metal Tutorial 5"**, created for educational and practice purposes. The project demonstrates key sheet metal design principles including base flanges, edge flanges, cuts, mirrored features, and a flat pattern.

## 🧩 Features

- **Sheet Metal Part Modeling** in SOLIDWORKS.
- Fully defined **2D technical drawing** with:
  - Top, front, bottom, and side views.
  - Section and detail views.
  - Dimension annotations in millimeters.
  - Hole callouts and bend information.
- Includes **Flat Pattern View** for manufacturing reference.
- Incorporates common sheet metal features:
  - Base-Flange
  - Cut-Extrudes (holes, slots)
  - Break-Corners (Fillets)
  - Mirror entities
  - Tabs and edge flanges

## 📐 Design Specifications

- All dimensions are in **millimeters**.
- **Corner radius** (undimensioned): 2mm.
- **Sheet thickness**: As per the base flange (not dimensioned in the drawing but inferred from views).
- **Flat Pattern Length**: 274.27mm.
- **Bend Tags**: 90° angles with 2mm internal bend radii (as per bend table).
- **Hole Information**:
  - Ø3.5mm holes (x8)
  - Ø3.3mm holes (x4)
  - Ø24mm large circular cutout
