# 🔧 Sheet Metal Tutorial – Mounting Bracket

This repository contains a tutorial sheet metal design of a **mounting bracket**, modeled in **SOLIDWORKS**. It demonstrates intermediate sheet metal techniques, including multiple bends, slot features, and mounting holes with precise dimensions.



## 🧰 Features Demonstrated

- Multi-angle bend operations (including non-orthogonal bends)
- Slotted holes and circular holes
- Flat pattern generation
- Precise radius and angle bends
- Use of fixed face for flat pattern orientation

## 📝 Drawing Notes

- All dimensions are in **millimeters**
- Bending inside radius: **2 mm**
- Hole diameter for fasteners: Ø5 mm
- Slot radius: R7.5 mm
- All features designed for manufacturability in standard sheet metal fabrication

| A   | UP        | 90°     | 2 mm          |
| B   | UP        | 90°     | 2 mm          |
| C   | UP        | 90°     | 2 mm          |
| D   | UP        | 70.81°  | 2 mm          |
| E   | UP        | 70.81°  | 2 mm          |
| F   | DOWN      | 80.41°  | 2 mm          |
| H   | DOWN      | 80.41°  | 2 mm          |
| J   | DOWN      | 90°     | 2 mm          |
