# Advanced Modeling Tools - II - Exercise Repository

Welcome to the repository containing the exercise files for learning advanced modeling tools from Chapter 8. This repository is designed to help you practice and master additional advanced modeling techniques.

## Chapter 8: Advanced Modeling Tools - II

### Learning Objectives:
By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Mirror features, faces, and bodies
- Create linear patterns
- Create circular patterns
- Create sketch-driven patterns
- Create curve-driven patterns
- Create table-driven patterns
- Create rib features
- Display the section view of a model
- Change the display state of a part

### Key Concepts:
- **Mirroring**: Reflecting features, faces, or bodies across a plane.
- **Linear Patterns**: Creating repeated patterns of features along a linear direction.
- **Circular Patterns**: Creating repeated patterns of features around a center point.
- **Sketch-driven Patterns**: Using sketches to drive the placement of features.
- **Curve-driven Patterns**: Using curves as the path for creating patterns.
- **Table-driven Patterns**: Defining pattern parameters using a table.
- **Rib Features**: Adding structural ribs to a model for strength.
- **Section View**: Displaying the internal structure of a model.
- **Display States**: Changing how a part is displayed without affecting the model.
