## Project Description
The **Drill Jig Assembly** is a mechanical device used to guide drilling tools to ensure accurate and consistent hole placement in workpieces. It consists of a base, workpiece, drill plate, jig bushes, hand nut, location post, washer, and screws. This project involves creating 3D models of all components and assembling them based on the provided technical drawings.

## Detailed Description
The Drill Jig Assembly is designed to provide precision and repeatability in drilling operations. The key components include:
- **Base**: The foundation of the jig, providing stability and support.
- **Workpiece**: The material to be drilled, held in place by the jig.
- **Drill Plate**: Guides the drill bit to the correct location on the workpiece.
- **Jig Bushes**: Ensure the drill bit remains aligned during the drilling process.
- **Hand Nut**: Used to secure the workpiece in place.
- **Location Post**: Positions the workpiece accurately on the base.
- **Washer**: Distributes the load and prevents damage to the workpiece.
- **Screw**: Fastens the components together.

This assembly is widely used in manufacturing and machining processes where precision drilling is required.
