## Project Description
The **Foot Step Bearing Assembly** is a mechanical component used to support rotating shafts in machinery. It consists of a supporting bracket, shaft, bush, thrust pad, pin, locking plate, and screws. This project involves creating 3D models of all components and assembling them based on the provided technical drawings.

## Detailed Description
The Foot Step Bearing Assembly is designed to provide stable support for rotating shafts while minimizing friction and wear. The key components include:
- **Supporting Bracket**: Acts as the base and provides structural support.
- **Shaft**: The rotating component supported by the bearing.
- **Bush**: Reduces friction between the shaft and the supporting bracket.
- **Thrust Pad**: Absorbs axial loads and prevents metal-to-metal contact.
- **Pin**: Secures the thrust pad in place.
- **Locking Plate**: Prevents the shaft from moving axially.
- **Screw**: Fastens the locking plate to the shaft.

This assembly is commonly used in industrial machinery, automotive applications, and heavy equipment where rotational stability is critical.

## Assembly Instructions
1. Start with the **Supporting Bracket** (Item No. 1) as the base component.
2. Insert the **Bush** (Item No. 2) into the supporting bracket.
3. Place the **Thrust Pad** (Item No. 3) on top of the bush and secure it with the **Pin** (Item No. 4).
4. Insert the **Shaft** (Item No. 5) into the bush and thrust pad.
5. Attach the **Locking Plate** (Item No. 6) to the shaft to prevent axial movement.
6. Secure the locking plate using the **Screw** (Item No. 7).
7. Ensure all parts are aligned correctly as per the technical drawings.
