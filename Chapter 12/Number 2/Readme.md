# Pipe Vice Assembly in SOLIDWORKS

## Overview

This repository contains resources and tutorials for creating a **Pipe Vice Assembly** in SOLIDWORKS. The tutorial includes modeling individual components and assembling them into a functional vice.

## Features

- **Step-by-step guide** to modeling each component
- **Pipe Vice assembly** as shown in Figure 12-80
- **Detailed component dimensions** from Figures 12-81 through 12-83
- **Best practices** for assembly constraints and mates
- **Exploded view and animations** for better visualization

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- SOLIDWORKS installed (version 2020 or later recommended)
- Basic understanding of part modeling and assembly concepts

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/pipe-vice-assembly.git
   ```
2. Open SOLIDWORKS and load the provided `.SLDPRT` and `.SLDASM` files.

## Usage

- Follow the tutorial to **create all components** of the Pipe Vice.
- Assemble them using **mates** and constraints.
- Refer to the **detailed technical drawings** for dimensions and specifications.
- Modify and experiment with different assembly techniques.

## Components

| ITEM NO | PART NO       | DESCRIPTION    | QTY |
|---------|--------------|---------------|-----|
| 1       | Base         | Main structure | 1   |
| 2       | Moveable Jaw | Clamping jaw  | 1   |
| 3       | Screw        | Adjustment screw | 1   |
| 4       | Handle       | Rotating handle | 1   |
| 5       | Handle Stop  | End stops      | 2   |
