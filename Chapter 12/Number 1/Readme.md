# Bench Vice Assembly in SOLIDWORKS

## Overview
This repository contains resources and tutorials for creating a **Bench Vice Assembly** in SOLIDWORKS. The tutorial includes modeling individual components and assembling them into a functional vice.

## Features
- **Step-by-step guide** to modeling each component
- **Bench Vice assembly** as shown in Figure 12-55
- **Detailed component dimensions** from Figures 12-56 through 12-60
- **Best practices** for assembly constraints and mates
- **Exploded view and animations** for better visualization

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- SOLIDWORKS installed (version 2020 or later recommended)
- Basic understanding of part modeling and assembly concepts

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/bench-vice-assembly.git
   ```
2. Open SOLIDWORKS and load the provided `.SLDPRT` and `.SLDASM` files.

## Usage
- Follow the tutorial to **create all components** of the Bench Vice.
- Assemble them using **mates** and constraints.
- Refer to the **detailed technical drawings** for dimensions and specifications.
- Modify and experiment with different assembly techniques.
