## Project Description
The **Knuckle Joint Assembly** is a mechanical component used to connect two rods or components that are under tension. It allows for angular movement and is commonly used in applications such as tie rods, bridges, and mechanical linkages. This project involves creating 3D models of all components and assembling them based on the provided technical drawings.

---

## Detailed Description
The Knuckle Joint Assembly consists of the following key components:
- **Fork**: Connects to one rod and has two prongs to hold the eye.
- **Eye**: Connects to the other rod and fits between the prongs of the fork.
- **Knuckle Pin**: Passes through the fork and eye to hold them together.
- **Collar**: Secures the knuckle pin in place.
- **Taper Pin**: Locks the collar to prevent the knuckle pin from sliding out.

This assembly is designed to handle high tensile loads while allowing for flexibility and angular movement. It is widely used in mechanical and structural applications where rigid connections are not feasible.

## Assembly Instructions
1. Start with the **Fork** (Item No. 1) and the **Eye** (Item No. 2).
2. Insert the **Eye** between the prongs of the **Fork**.
3. Pass the **Knuckle Pin** (Item No. 3) through the aligned holes in the fork and eye.
4. Slide the **Collar** (Item No. 4) onto the knuckle pin to secure it in place.
5. Insert the **Taper Pins** (Item No. 5) into the collar to lock it and prevent the knuckle pin from sliding out.
6. Ensure all parts are aligned correctly as per the technical drawings.
