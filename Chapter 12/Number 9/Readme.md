## Project Description
The **Machine Vice Assembly** is a mechanical device used to hold workpieces securely in place during machining operations such as drilling, milling, or filing. It consists of a base, fixed jaw, sliding jaw, screw spindle, block, end plate, and screws. This project involves creating 3D models of all components and assembling them based on the provided technical drawings.

## Detailed Description
The Machine Vice Assembly is designed to provide a strong and stable grip on workpieces. The key components include:
- **Base**: The foundation of the vice, providing stability and support.
- **Fixed Jaw**: Attached to the base and remains stationary.
- **Sliding Jaw**: Moves along the base to clamp the workpiece.
- **Screw Spindle**: Drives the movement of the sliding jaw.
- **Block**: Connects the screw spindle to the sliding jaw.
- **End Plate**: Secures the screw spindle in place.
- **Screws**: Used to fasten various components together.

This assembly is widely used in workshops and manufacturing facilities for precision machining tasks.
