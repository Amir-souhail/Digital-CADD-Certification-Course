## Project Description
The **Simple Eccentric Assembly** is a mechanical device used to convert rotary motion into linear motion. It consists of straps, sheaves, shims, cheese head bolts, nuts, and lock nuts. This project involves creating 3D models of all components and assembling them based on the provided technical drawings.

---

## Detailed Description
The Simple Eccentric Assembly is designed to provide controlled linear motion through the use of eccentric components. The key components include:
- **Strap No.1** and **Strap No.2**: Provide structural support and housing for the eccentric mechanism.
- **Sheave**: The rotating component that creates the eccentric motion.
- **Shim**: Ensures proper alignment and reduces friction between components.
- **Cheese Head Bolt**: Fastens the straps and sheave together.
- **Nut** and **Lock Nut**: Secure the bolts in place to prevent loosening during operation.

This assembly is commonly used in machinery where precise linear motion is required, such as in presses, pumps, and actuators.

## Assembly Instructions
1. Start with **Strap No.1** (Item No. 1) and **Strap No.2** (Item No. 2) as the base components.
2. Place the **Sheave** (Item No. 3) between the straps.
3. Insert the **Shims** (Item No. 4) to ensure proper alignment and reduce friction.
4. Use the **Cheese Head Bolts** (Item No. 5) to fasten the straps and sheave together.
5. Secure the bolts with the **Nuts** (Item No. 6) and **Lock Nuts** (Item No. 7) to prevent loosening.
6. Ensure all parts are aligned correctly as per the technical drawings.
