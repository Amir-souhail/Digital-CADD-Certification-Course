# SOLIDWORKS Certification Course Practices

Welcome to my SOLIDWORKS Certification Course Practices repository! This repository contains all the practice files, projects, and exercises I am working on as part of my SOLIDWORKS certification course. The goal of this repository is to document my learning journey, share my progress, and provide a resource for others who are also learning SOLIDWORKS.
