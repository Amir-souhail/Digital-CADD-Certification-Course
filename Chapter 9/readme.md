# Editing Features - Exercise Repository

Welcome to the repository containing the exercise files for learning how to edit features in SolidWorks. This repository is designed to help you practice and master various feature-editing techniques.

## Chapter 9: Editing Features

### Learning Objectives:
By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Edit features
- Edit the sketch plane of the sketch-based features
- Cut, copy, and paste features and sketches
- Delete features and bodies
- Suppress and unsuppress features
- Move or copy bodies
- Reorder features
- Roll back the model
- Rename features
- Use the What’s Wrong functionality

### Key Concepts:
- **Feature Editing**: Modify existing features without affecting other parts of the model.
- **Sketch Plane**: Changing the plane of a feature’s sketch.
- **Cut, Copy, Paste**: Basic actions to manipulate features and sketches.
- **Suppressing Features**: Temporarily turning off features to simplify the model.
- **Reordering Features**: Adjusting the sequence of features for different outcomes.
- **Rolling Back**: Reverting the model to a previous state.
- **What’s Wrong**: Using diagnostic tools to identify issues with the model.
