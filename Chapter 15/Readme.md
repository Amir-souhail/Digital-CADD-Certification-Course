| Feature                             | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Annotations**                     | I can add text notes, symbols, or custom labels directly on drawing views. |
| **Reference Dimensions**            | These help to describe non-driving measurements for clarity.               |
| **Surface Finish Symbols**          | Indicate surface quality requirements for manufacturing.                   |
| **Datum & Geometric Tolerance**     | Define inspection references and allowable geometric variances.            |
| **Centerlines & Callouts**          | Aid machinists in part positioning and identification.                     |
| **Cosmetic Threads & Dowel Pins**   | Help represent threaded holes and alignment features on 2D views.          |
| **Bill of Materials (BOM)**         | Automatically generates a tabular breakdown of assembly parts.             |
| **Balloons**                        | Graphically link parts in the view to entries in the BOM.                  |
| **New Sheets**                      | Organize large projects across multiple pages.                             |
| **Sheet Formatting**                | Customize layout, border styles, and title blocks.                         |
| **User-defined Sheet Templates**    | Allow me to standardize drawing formats for repeated use.                  |
| **Magnetic Lines**                  | Helps me align and manage balloons in a neat, readable way.                |

## 🏭 Industry Applications

Drawing documentation is a critical part of the product lifecycle and widely used in various fields including:

- **Aerospace & Defense**: Detailed annotations and tolerancing are essential for mission-critical parts.  
- **Automotive Engineering**: BOMs and exploded views assist in part sourcing and assembly planning.  
- **Industrial Machinery**: Clear drawings help fabricators build complex machines efficiently.  
- **Consumer Products**: Sheet templates and surface finishes ensure high-quality prototyping.  
- **Electronics & Mechatronics**: Accurate hole positions and cosmetic threads for PCB enclosures.  
- **Marine & Underwater Vehicles**: Used extensively in AUV designs like the UTRACKER system.
