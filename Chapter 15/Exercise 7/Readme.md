# Chapter 15 ‚Äì Working with Drawing Views-II

This repository is part of the *DigitalCADD Certification Course*, and contains drawing sheets and files related to Chapter 15 of my SolidWorks learning journey. In this chapter, I worked with detailed 2D drawing views in SolidWorks, learning how to communicate design intent with annotations, dimensions, and symbols.

## üìò Summary of Chapter 15

In this chapter, I learned how to:
- Add and edit **annotations** in drawing views
- Add **reference dimensions and notes** using Smart Dimension and Baseline dimensioning
- Add **geometric tolerance symbols** (GD&T) to drawing views
- Use **datum feature symbols** and define datum references
- Create **center marks** and **centerlines**
- Format sheets by adding new views and editing layout

## üß∞ Included Drawings and Techniques Used

### 1. Vice Body Drawing
- Created using **Smart Dimensions** and **Baseline Dimensioning**
- Different orthographic views and an **isometric view** are included
- Applied techniques:
  - Reference dimensioning
  - Linear and angular dimensions
  - Section layout with multiple viewports

**File Previews:**
- `Vice Body_smart Dimension.JPG`
- `Vice Body_smart Dimension_BaseLine.pdf`

### 2. Base Plate Drawing
- Focused on applying **Geometric Dimensioning & Tolerancing (GD&T)**
- Feature control frames include **position tolerance** and **datum references**
- Shows how to define features with **MMC**, **LMC**, and **material boundaries**

**File Preview:**
- `Base.JPG`
