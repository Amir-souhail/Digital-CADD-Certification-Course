## 📐 Dimensioning Techniques

### 📐 Angular Running Dimensions
**Example Angles:**

20° → 10° → 5° → 4° → 3° → 2° → 1°


![Angular Dimension Example](./Cover_Angular_running.jpg)

**Best Practices:**
- Use for consecutive angular features
- Ideal for tapered surfaces
- Maintain consistent reference edges
- Place near the feature for clarity
