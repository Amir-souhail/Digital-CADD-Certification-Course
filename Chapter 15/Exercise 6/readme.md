# 🧰 Chapter 15: Working with Drawing Views-II

This repository is part of the **DigitalCADD Certification Course** and explores key drawing annotation tools in SOLIDWORKS through **Chapter 15: Working with Drawing Views-II**. I have applied these concepts to the *Cover* component shown below using **Angular Running Dimensions**.

## 📘 Chapter Summary

| Feature                              | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Add and Edit Annotations**         | Annotations highlight angular positions of features in circular layout.     |
| **Apply Angular Running Dimensions** | Demonstrated angular dimensions in radial pattern using 0°, 30°, 60°, etc. |
| **Add Center Marks and Centerlines** | Centerlines help define radial symmetry and placement.                      |
| **Edit the Sheet Format**            | Drawing uses A0 format with a customized title block.                       |
| **Use of Smart Dimension Tool**      | Angular dimensions added using the Smart Dimension tool in SOLIDWORKS.      |
| **Multiple Drawing Views**           | Included views for clarity and visual reference.                            |
