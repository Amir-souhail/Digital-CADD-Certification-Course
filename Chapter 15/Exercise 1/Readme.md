## ✨ Chapter 15 Topics Applied

| Feature                             | Description |
|-------------------------------------|-------------|
| **Add and Edit Annotations**        | I applied annotations to highlight critical features such as holes and faces. |
| **Reference Dimensions & Notes**    | Dimensional annotations and notes were used for manufacturing clarity. |
| **Geometric Tolerance Symbols**     | I used tolerance callouts on hole features to ensure precise fits. |
| **Centerlines and Center Marks**    | Centerlines and marks were included for symmetric and circular features. |
| **Hole Callouts**                   | Detailed information like hole size, type, and depth were added. |
| **Edit the Sheet Format**           | Customized the sheet layout with a clean title block and border. |
