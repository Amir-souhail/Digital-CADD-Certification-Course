This repository showcases my technical drawing of a **Vice Body** component using **SOLIDWORKS**, aligned with **Chapter 15** of the **DigitalCADD Certification Course**. The focus of this chapter is on advanced annotations and customizations in drawing views to generate clear, production-ready documentation.

## ✨ Chapter 15 Topics Applied

| Feature                              | Description |
|--------------------------------------|-------------|
| **Smart Dimensioning (Annotations)** | I used Smart Dimension tools to fully define the views and capture manufacturing intent. |
| **Reference Dimensions & Notes**     | Clear linear, radial, and angular references were added to ensure production accuracy. |
| **Centerlines and Center Marks**     | I inserted center marks for holes and symmetric features to help guide machining. |
| **Edit the Sheet Format**            | The sheet includes a customized title block and layout to meet industry standards. |

## 🏭 Real-World Applications

The Vice Body model and drawing are applicable in:

- **Manufacturing & Machining** – Ideal for CNC programming and operator interpretation.
- **Fixture Design** – As a base or supporting element in jigs and fixtures.
- **Mechanical Prototyping** – Used in student and industry-level prototype assemblies.
- **Technical Education** – A typical exercise in SOLIDWORKS-based CAD training programs.
- **Product Design Documentation** – For creating revision-controlled drawing sets.

## 🎯 Learning Outcome

Through this drawing exercise, I learned how to:

- Use **Smart Dimensioning** to quickly and accurately annotate all critical features.
- Create a **clean multi-view technical sheet** with isometric projection.
- Communicate design intent using **standard drawing conventions**.
- Deliver documentation aligned with **industry-ready practices**.
