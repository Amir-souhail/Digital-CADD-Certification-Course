# 🏀 Ball Surface Modeling (SOLIDWORKS)



This repository contains my practice model for **Surface Modeling** using SOLIDWORKS as part of the certification course offered by **Digital CADD Solutions**. The model represents a ball-like part built using various surface features and advanced modeling techniques.

## 📚 Chapter 16: Surface Modeling

Surface modeling allows me to create smooth, freeform, and complex geometries that would be challenging to make with traditional solid features. This ball design helps me explore surface operations like revolved shapes, surface trims, boundary surfaces, and mirror techniques to complete a symmetric 3D model.

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

After completing this practice, I was able to:

- Revolve sketches into surfaces
- Offset existing surfaces
- Create 3D curves and guide surfaces
- Trim surfaces precisely to match complex profiles
- Use boundary surfaces for custom transitions
- Knit surfaces into a closed surface body
- Apply surface fillets
- Mirror half of a model to save time and maintain symmetry
- Convert a surface body into a solid using the Thicken feature

## 🔧 Feature Tree Explanation

| 🔧 Feature Name        | 📝 Description |
|------------------------|----------------|
| **Surface-Revolve1**   | I used this to create the main ball shape by revolving a 2D sketch around an axis. This formed the base shell of the ball geometry. |
| **Surface-Offset1**    | I created an offset of the revolved surface to begin the inner shell and set up for trimming. |
| **Curve1**             | A 3D sketch used to guide the trimming or boundary surface features. Helps add custom contour or design to the surface. |
| **Surface-Trim1**      | I removed sections of the offset surface using a sketch or face as a reference. |
| **Curve2**             | Another 3D sketch added to help define additional trimming or feature geometry. |
| **Surface-Trim3**      | A further trimming operation to finalize the outer pattern. |
| **Boundary-Surface1**  | I used this to fill or blend between surface edges with more control over tangency and curvature. |
| **Surface-Knit1**      | This helped me combine all trimmed and boundary surfaces into one single surface body. |
| **Fillet2**            | I smoothed sharp intersections between surfaces to create a more realistic and functional design. |
| **Thicken1**           | I converted the surface into a solid part by thickening the shell. |
| **Mirror1**            | I mirrored the completed half to make the full symmetric ball model. |

This model helped me understand advanced surfacing features and how to bring them together into a manufacturable, symmetric product design.
