# SOLIDWORKS Surfacing Practice - Exercise 1

## 📌 Exercise Overview

This project is based on Exercise 1 from the surfacing section of the SOLIDWORKS curriculum. The objective is to create a complex part using surface modeling techniques.

**Reference Drawing:**  
Figure 16-158 (included as `Drawing.jpg`)

**Expected Time:** 1 hour  
**Main Focus:**  
- Surface creation using lofts and trims  
- Surface knitting  
- Adding thickness  
- Filleting and mirroring geometry

---

## 🛠️ Features Used

- **Surface-Loft**
- **Surface-Trim**
- **Surface-Knit**
- **Thicken**
- **Fillet**
- **Mirror**

All features are sequentially shown in the **FeatureManager Design Tree**, visible in `Feature Tree.jpg`.

## 📌 Modeling Steps Summary

1. **Create multiple planes** for symmetry and geometry references.
2. Use **lofted surfaces** to define the main forms.
3. **Trim and stitch surfaces** using `Surface-Trim` and `Surface-Knit`.
4. Convert the final surface body to solid using `Thicken`.
5. Apply **fillets** as per drawing.
6. Use **Mirror** to complete symmetric features.

## 💡 Notes

- Filleting was done post-knitting to maintain clean curvature transitions.
- Some symmetry features were efficiently handled using the mirror tool.

---

## 🔧 Requirements

- SOLIDWORKS 2020 or later
- Basic understanding of surface modeling tools
