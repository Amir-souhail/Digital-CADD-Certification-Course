## 📂 Feature Tree Breakdown  
The model follows a **surface-first approach**, converted to a solid at the final stage. Below is the structure of the CAD feature tree:  

### **Reference Geometry**  
- **Default Planes:** Front, Top, Right, Origin  
- **User-Defined Planes:** Plane1 through Plane6 (used for construction)  

### **Surface Modeling Stages**  
1. **Base Construction**  
   - `Surface-Loft1` → Main body created by lofting open sections  
   - `Surface-Plane1` → Planar surface to close the right face  

2. **Handle Development**  
   - `Surface-Loft2` → Handle structure (lofted between open sections)  
   - `Surface-Trim1` → Trimming excess handle surfaces  
   - `Surface-Plane3` → Planar surface to close the front face  

3. **Grip Features**  
   - `Surface-Extrude1` → Elliptical grips extruded  
   - `Surface-Trim2` → Unwanted surfaces trimmed  

4. **Surface Detailing**  
   - `Surface-Loft3` → Dip feature on the top surface  
   - `Surface-Trim3`, `Surface-Trim4` → Air vent creation  

### **Final Solid Conversion**  
- `Surface-Knit1` → All surfaces combined  
- `Thicken2` → Converted to 1mm solid body  
- `Fillet6` to `Fillet9` → Edge smoothing  
- `Mirror1` → Completes full symmetric model

## 📝 Step-by-Step Tutorial  

### **1. Base Surface Creation**  
- Loft open sections along guide curves to form the main body.  
- Close the right face with a planar surface (`Surface-Plane1`).  

### **2. Handle Construction**  
- Create a lofted surface between two open sections for the handle.  
- Trim unwanted portions (`Surface-Trim1`).  
- Close the front face with a planar surface (`Surface-Plane3`).  

### **3. Grip Features**  
- Extrude elliptical sketches to form the grips.  
- Trim excess material (`Surface-Trim2`).  

### **4. Surface Detailing**  
- Add a dip on the top surface (`Surface-Loft3`).  
- Trim surfaces to create air vents (`Surface-Trim3`, `Surface-Trim4`).  

### **5. Final Modeling**  
- Knit all surfaces into a single body (`Surface-Knit1`).  
- Apply fillets for smooth edges.  
- Thicken the surface to **1mm** (`Thicken2`).  
- Mirror the half-model to complete the design (`Mirror1`).

## 💻 Supported CAD Software  
This tutorial is applicable to most **surface-modeling CAD tools**, including:  
- SolidWorks (likely used for this example)  
- Autodesk Inventor  
- CATIA  
- Siemens NX  
- PTC Creo  

---

## 📌 Notes  
- **Detail A** (in drawings) should be viewed at **2:1 scale** for precision.  
- The **mirror operation** implies symmetry, allowing half-modeling for efficiency.  
- All dimensions are in **millimeters (mm)**.
