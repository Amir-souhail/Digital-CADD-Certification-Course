# ðŸ§ª Tutorial 1 Surface Modeling (SOLIDWORKS)

This document contains my work and reflections on **Tutorial 1.0** from Chapter 16: *Surface Modeling* of the SOLIDWORKS certification course by **Digital CADD Solutions**.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Outcomes

After completing this tutorial, I was able to:

- Create a base surface using the **Revolve with Mid Plane** option
- Trim and fillet surface bodies to refine complex shapes
- Use planes and offsets to define auxiliary sketches and features
- Apply **Lofted** and **Planar** surfaces to bridge gaps and close models
- Perform surface operations like **Trim**, **Knit**, and **Thicken**
- Develop a complete 3D solid body from surface features

## ðŸ“˜ Tutorial 1.0 Overview

This tutorial focuses on creating a surface-based model of a complex part using the tools in the **Surfaces CommandManager**. The final goal is to generate a solid part by thickening the completed surface body.

### ðŸ”§ Steps Summary

a. Create the base surface of the model by revolving the sketch using the **Mid Plane** option through 180 degrees.  
b. Create the second surface feature.  
c. Trim the extruded surface using the trim tool.  
d. Add fillet to the trimmed base surface.  
e. Create a plane at an offset distance of 40 mm from the Top plane.  
f. Create a lofted surface.  
g. Create a planar surface on the top of the lofted feature and trim the base feature using the lofted feature.  
h. Trim and knit all surfaces together.  
i. Add fillets to the surface model.  
j. Add thickness to the knitted surface.

## ðŸŒ² Feature Tree Explanation

Hereâ€™s a brief explanation of the key features used in the model:

- **Sketch1**: The base profile used for the revolve feature.
- **Revolve-Surface1**: A 180Â° mid-plane revolved surface that forms the main body.
- **Extrude-Surface1**: A secondary surface added perpendicular to the revolved body.
- **Trim-Surface1**: Used to remove overlapping or unnecessary areas of the extruded surface.
- **Fillet1**: Applies smooth fillets to specific edges of the surface for cleaner transitions.
- **Plane1**: A reference plane created 40mm above the top plane to define the loft's upper profile.
- **Sketch2 & Sketch3**: Profiles that guide the shape of the **Lofted Surface**.
- **Lofted-Surface1**: Connects two sketches to create a smooth transition surface.
- **Planar-Surface1**: Caps off the top of the lofted surface.
- **Trim-Surface2**: Additional trimming of the revolved body using the loft and planar surface edges.
- **Knit-Surface1**: Combines multiple trimmed and lofted surfaces into a single knitted body.
- **Fillet2**: Applies fillets at selected intersections to refine the knitted shape.
- **Thicken1**: Converts the final surface body into a solid model with uniform wall thickness.
