# Advanced Modeling Tools - IV - Exercise Repository

Welcome to the repository containing the exercise files for learning advanced modeling tools from Chapter 11. This repository is designed to help you practice and master advanced features in SolidWorks.

## Chapter 11: Advanced Modeling Tools - IV

### Learning Objectives:
By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Create dome features
- Create indent features
- Create deform features
- Create flex features
- Create fastening features
- Create freeform features
- Dimension a part using DimXpert

### Key Concepts:
- **Dome Features**: Creating curved surfaces that are symmetrical around an axis.
- **Indent Features**: Modifying the shape of a part by pressing another part into it.
- **Deform Features**: Modifying parts using non-linear geometry modifications.
- **Flex Features**: Introducing flexible or dynamic changes in a partâ€™s geometry.
- **Fastening Features**: Incorporating methods of fixing parts in place within an assembly.
- **Freeform Features**: Creating complex, freeform surfaces with minimal restrictions.
- **DimXpert**: Automatically applying dimensions and annotations to your models.
