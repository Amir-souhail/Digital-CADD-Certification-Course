## 🧭 Overview

This GitHub repository is my personal record for the **Weldments module** of a SOLIDWORKS training program. It includes custom profiles, part files, notes, and automation tools.  
The goal is to create a clean, reusable, and well-documented workspace that reflects what I’ve learned.

---

## 🧠 What I’ve Learned

✅ Creating and importing `.SLDLFP` weldment profiles  
✅ Using 2D/3D sketches to define structural members  
✅ Grouping and trimming structural bodies  
✅ Managing corner treatments (trim, extend, rotate)  
✅ Setting up library folders in SOLIDWORKS
