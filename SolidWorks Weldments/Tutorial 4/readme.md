# README for DigitalCADD Certification - Tutorial 4  

## Overview  
This repository contains the exercise materials for **Tutorial 4** of the **DigitalCADD Certification** program. The tutorial provides a technical drawing for practicing CAD modeling and engineering drawing interpretation.  

## Contents  
- **Tutorial 4.pdf**: A sample mechanical assembly drawing featuring:  
  - Orthographic views with detailed dimensions (in millimeters)  
  - Bill of Materials (BOM) listing components  
  - Standard tolerances (UNI ISO 2768)  
  - Manufacturing notes (deburring, surface finish, etc.)  
  - Title block with revision history  

## Learning Objectives  
Through this exercise, you will:  
✔ Practice interpreting mechanical drawings  
✔ Apply dimensioning standards  
✔ Model an assembly in CAD  
✔ Understand manufacturing callouts  
✔ Work with scaled drawings (1:5)  

## Key Features to Note  
- Square tube components (80×80×5 mm)  
- 45° angled features  
- Through holes ("10.00 THRU ALL")  
- Radius specifications (R10.00)  
- Surface finish requirements  

## Instructions  
1. Analyze all views and dimensions  
2. Recreate the model in your CAD software  
3. Verify all tolerances and specifications  
4. Cross-check against the reference drawing
