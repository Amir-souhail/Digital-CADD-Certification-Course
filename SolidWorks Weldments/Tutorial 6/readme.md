## 🧾 Project Description

This repository contains the design files, weldment structures, and technical drawing for a **steel staircase** fabricated using **C-Channels** and **circular pipes**. The model was created as part of **Tutorial 07** of my SOLIDWORKS training program, focusing on structural design using the **Weldments** environment.

---

## 🧱 Key Features

- ✅ Fully parametric **3D weldment model**
- ✅ Accurate cut list with custom structural profiles
- ✅ Engineering drawing with dimensions and isometric views
- ✅ Uses **C-Channel 120x12mm** and **Pipe Ø33.7x4.0mm**
- ✅ Realistic fabrication layout including handrails and stringers
