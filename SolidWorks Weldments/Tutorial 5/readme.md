# README for DigitalCADD Certification - Tutorial 5

## Overview
This repository contains the exercise materials for **Tutorial 5** of the **DigitalCADD Certification** program. The tutorial provides a technical drawing for a structural assembly, focusing on interpreting engineering drawings and CAD modeling practice.

## Contents
- **Tutorial 5.pdf**: A technical drawing featuring:
  - Orthographic views with detailed dimensions (in millimeters)
  - Bill of Materials (BOM) listing structural components
  - Manufacturing specifications and tolerances
  - Title block with revision history
  - Drawing scale: 1:10

## Key Components
The assembly includes:
- Angle bars (L2x2x0.125)
- Tubular sections (TS2x2x0.25)
- Pipes (1.5 SCH 40)
- Gusset plates (100×100×10mm)
- End caps (3X thickness ratio)
- Glass table top

## Learning Objectives
Through this exercise, you will:
✔ Practice interpreting structural drawings
✔ Understand standard structural components
✔ Apply dimensioning standards
✔ Model an assembly in CAD
✔ Work with manufacturing callouts

## Important Features
- Multiple structural steel components
- R5.00 radius specifications
- Various gusset plate configurations
- Glass table top integration
- Standard manufacturing notes (deburring, etc.)

## Instructions
1. Carefully analyze all views and dimensions
2. Recreate the model in your CAD software
3. Pay special attention to:
   - Component quantities and lengths
   - Different material specifications
   - Assembly relationships
4. Verify all tolerances and specifications

## Technical Notes
- All dimensions are in millimeters
- Drawing scale is 1:10 (do not scale drawing)
- Follow standard deburring and edge-breaking practices
- Materials include structural steel and glass

*Note: This is practice material for educational purposes as part of the DigitalCADD Certification program.*
