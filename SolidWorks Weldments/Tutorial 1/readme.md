# 📐 SOLIDWORKS Weldment Tutorial - Project 01

This project contains a SOLIDWORKS weldment model based on the technical drawing provided in `01.jpg`. It demonstrates basic structural design using square tube profiles and includes detailed 2D drafting annotations for fabrication and assembly reference.

## 📁 File Contents

* `Project01.SLDPRT` – Main weldment part file with structural members, gusset, and end caps.
* `Project01.SLDDRW` – Drawing file with views, dimensions, and part annotations.
* `01.jpg` – Reference image showing the complete 2D drawing and exploded isometric view.

## 🛠️ Notes

* **Units**: All dimensions are in **millimeters (mm)**.
* **Weld Gap**: There is a **0.10 mm gap** between the square tube and the end cap.
* **Fasteners**: 8 mm × 15 mm slots are added for fasteners, spaced 10 mm apart.
* **Welds**: Gusset and tubing are assumed to be welded at intersecting joints.
* **Angles**: The gusset is cut at a **45° angle** to provide corner reinforcement.
