# SOLIDWORKS Certification Practice (Chapters 1-7)  

This repository contains practice exercises from Chapters 1-7 of my SOLIDWORKS certification course. These exercises cover fundamental to advanced topics, including sketching, dimensioning, reference geometries, and advanced modeling tools.  

## 📌 About SOLIDWORKS  
SOLIDWORKS is a leading 3D CAD software used for designing parametric models, assemblies, and technical drawings. The exercises in this repository focus on improving proficiency with SOLIDWORKS tools and features.  

## 📁 Repository Structure  
All practice exercises are stored in a single folder:
