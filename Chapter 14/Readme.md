## 📚 Topics Covered  

### 1️⃣ **Understanding Drawing Mode**  
SolidWorks **Drawing Mode** is used to create **2D drawings** of 3D models. These drawings are critical in **manufacturing, production, and design documentation**.  

### 2️⃣ **Starting a Drawing Document**  
Users can start a new drawing document in two ways:  
- **Using the New SolidWorks Document dialog box.**  
- **Accessing drawing options within a part or assembly.**  

### 3️⃣ **Generative vs. Interactive Drafting**  
- **Generative Drafting:** Automatically generates drawing views from a model.  
- **Interactive Drafting:** Allows manual sketching and modifications directly in **Drawing Mode**.  

### 4️⃣ **Generating Different Types of Views**  
- **Standard Views** (Top, Front, Right, Isometric)  
- **Exploded Views** (For assemblies)  
- **Section Views** (To reveal internal details)  
- **Detail Views** (For close-up examination)  
- **Broken Views** (For elongated parts)  

### 5️⃣ **Editing & Modifying Views**  
- **Repositioning drawing views.**  
- **Changing the view scale for clarity.**  
- **Updating views when the model changes.**  

### 6️⃣ **Bidirectional Associativity**  
Any changes in the **Part or Assembly Mode** automatically update in **Drawing Mode**, ensuring consistency and reducing errors.  

### 7️⃣ **Hatch Pattern Modifications**  
Section views include **hatching** to indicate material cuts. Users can:  
- Adjust **hatch spacing and patterns**.  
- Modify **hatching to represent different materials**.
