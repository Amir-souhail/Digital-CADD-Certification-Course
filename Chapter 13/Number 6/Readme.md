## Project Description
The **Ball Bearing Assembly** is a mechanical assembly used to reduce friction between rotating parts. It consists of an outer ring, inner ring, balls, cage, and rivet pins. This project involves creating 3D models of all components, assembling them into the complete ball bearing, and preparing technical drawings.

---

## Detailed Description
The Ball Bearing Assembly is designed to provide smooth rotational motion with minimal friction. The key components include:
- **Outer Ring**: The stationary part of the bearing that fits into the housing.
- **Inner Ring**: The rotating part of the bearing that fits onto the shaft.
- **Balls**: Roll between the inner and outer rings to reduce friction.
- **Cage**: Holds the balls in place and maintains their spacing.
- **Rivet Pins**: Secure the cage to maintain the position of the balls.

This assembly is widely used in various mechanical applications, including automotive, industrial machinery, and household appliances.
