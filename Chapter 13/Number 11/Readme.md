## Project Description
This project is part of the **Digital CADD Course Certification**, designed to teach students how to create and interpret technical drawings, design 3D models, and assemble mechanical components. The **Mecanum Wheel Assembly** is one of the key projects in the course, focusing on omnidirectional wheel systems and mechanical design.

## Part Description
The **Mecanum Wheel Assembly** is a specialized wheel system that allows for omnidirectional movement. It is commonly used in robotics and industrial applications where precise movement in any direction is required. The assembly includes the following key components:

### Key Components:
1. **Frame**: The main structure that holds the rollers and other components.
2. **Rollers**: The angled rollers that enable omnidirectional movement.
3. **Shaft**: The central shaft that connects the wheel to the motor or axle.
4. **Roller Brackets**: Components that hold the rollers in place.
5. **Bolts**: Fasteners used to secure the components together.

### Key Features:
- **Omnidirectional Movement**: The Mecanum wheel allows for movement in any direction without the need to reorient the wheel.
- **Precision Engineering**: The assembly requires precise alignment of rollers and brackets for optimal performance.
- **Dimensions**: The drawing includes critical dimensions to ensure accurate manufacturing or 3D printing.

### Possible Applications:
- **Robotics**: Used in robotic systems for precise and flexible movement.
- **Industrial Machinery**: Used in machinery requiring omnidirectional mobility.
- **Automotive**: Used in specialized vehicles for enhanced maneuverability.
