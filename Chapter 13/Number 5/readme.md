## Project Description
The **Four Cylinder Engine Assembly** is a mechanical assembly that simulates the structure of a four-cylinder internal combustion engine. This project involves creating 3D models of all components, assembling them into the complete engine, and preparing technical drawings.

---

## Detailed Description
The Four Cylinder Engine Assembly is designed to demonstrate the working principles of a four-cylinder engine. The key components include:
- **Engine Block**: The main housing that contains the cylinders and other internal components.
- **Crankshaft**: Converts the linear motion of the pistons into rotational motion.
- **Pistons**: Move within the cylinders to generate power.
- **Connecting Rods**: Connect the pistons to the crankshaft.
- **Cylinder Head**: Seals the top of the cylinders and contains the valves.
- **Valves**: Control the flow of air and fuel into the cylinders and the exhaust gases out.
- **Camshaft**: Controls the opening and closing of the valves.
- **Timing Belt/Chain**: Synchronizes the rotation of the crankshaft and camshaft.
- **Oil Pan**: Collects and stores engine oil.

This assembly is widely used in automotive and mechanical engineering education to understand the functioning of internal combustion engines.

## Assembly Instructions
1. Start with the **Engine Block** (Item No. 1) as the base component.
2. Insert the **Crankshaft** (Item No. 2) into the engine block.
3. Attach the **Pistons** (Item No. 3) to the **Connecting Rods** (Item No. 4) and then to the crankshaft.
4. Install the **Cylinder Head** (Item No. 5) onto the engine block.
5. Insert the **Valves** (Item No. 6) into the cylinder head.
6. Install the **Camshaft** (Item No. 7) and connect it to the crankshaft using the **Timing Belt/Chain** (Item No. 8).
7. Attach the **Oil Pan** (Item No. 9) to the bottom of the engine block.
8. Ensure all parts are aligned correctly as per the technical drawings.
