## Project Description
The **Stop Valve Assembly** is a mechanical device used to control the flow of fluids in pipelines. It consists of a body, cover, bridge, valve, valve seat, gland, spindle, collar, collar stud, studs, hand wheel, and various fasteners. This project involves creating 3D models of all components, assembling them, and preparing technical drawings.

## Detailed Description
The Stop Valve Assembly is designed to provide precise control over fluid flow. The key components include:
- **Body**: The main housing that contains the internal components.
- **Cover**: Seals the body and provides access to internal components.
- **Bridge**: Supports the spindle and other internal components.
- **Valve**: Controls the flow of fluid by opening or closing the valve seat.
- **Valve Seat**: Provides a sealing surface for the valve.
- **Gland**: Seals the spindle to prevent leakage.
- **Spindle**: Connects the hand wheel to the valve for manual control.
- **Collar**: Secures the spindle in place.
- **Collar Stud**: Connects the collar to the body.
- **Studs**: Secure the cover and other components to the body.
- **Hand Wheel**: Used to manually operate the valve.
- **Packing**: Provides additional sealing to prevent leakage.

This assembly is widely used in industrial and residential applications where fluid flow control is required.
