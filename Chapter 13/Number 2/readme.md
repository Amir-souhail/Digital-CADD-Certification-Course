## Detailed Description
The Lathe Tailstock Assembly is designed to provide stability and precision during lathe operations. The key components include:
- **Body**: The main structural component that houses the internal mechanisms.
- **Handle (Lock)**: Used to lock the tailstock in place.
- **Screw Spindle**: Facilitates the movement of the tailstock along the lathe bed.
- **Clamping Plate**: Secures the tailstock to the lathe bed.
- **Dead Centre**: Supports the workpiece during machining.
- **Barrel**: Houses the dead centre and allows for fine adjustments.
- **Stud**: Connects the barrel to the body.
- **Flange**: Provides additional support and alignment.
- **Hand Wheel**: Used to manually adjust the position of the tailstock.
- **Various Fasteners**: Includes screws, nuts, washers, and keys to secure the components.

This assembly is essential for achieving accurate and consistent machining results in lathe operations.
