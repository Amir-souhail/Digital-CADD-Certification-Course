## Project Description
The **Radial Engine Assembly** is a mechanical assembly that simulates the structure of a radial engine, commonly used in aircraft. This project involves creating 3D models of all components, assembling them into sub-assemblies, and then combining them into the main assembly. The exploded state and explode line sketch are also created to visualize the assembly process.

## Detailed Description
The Radial Engine Assembly is designed to demonstrate the working principles of a radial engine. The key components include:
- **Crankcase**: The central housing that holds the crankshaft and connecting rods.
- **Crankshaft**: Converts the linear motion of the pistons into rotational motion.
- **Connecting Rods**: Connect the pistons to the crankshaft.
- **Pistons**: Move within the cylinders to generate power.
- **Cylinders**: House the pistons and facilitate the combustion process.
- **Valves**: Control the flow of air and fuel into the cylinders.
- **Spark Plugs**: Ignite the air-fuel mixture in the cylinders.

This assembly is divided into two parts: **sub-assembly** and **main assembly**. The sub-assembly includes the crankcase, crankshaft, and connecting rods, while the main assembly combines all components into the final radial engine structure.

## Assembly Instructions
1. **Sub-Assembly**:
   - Start with the **Crankcase** (Item No. 1) as the base component.
   - Insert the **Crankshaft** (Item No. 2) into the crankcase.
   - Attach the **Connecting Rods** (Item No. 3) to the crankshaft.
   - Ensure all parts are aligned correctly as per the technical drawings.

2. **Main Assembly**:
   - Attach the **Pistons** (Item No. 4) to the connecting rods.
   - Install the **Cylinders** (Item No. 5) onto the crankcase.
   - Insert the **Valves** (Item No. 6) into the cylinders.
   - Install the **Spark Plugs** (Item No. 7) into the cylinders.
   - Ensure all parts are aligned correctly as per the technical drawings.

3. **Exploded State**:
   - Create the exploded state to visualize the assembly process.
   - Generate the explode line sketch to show the relationship between components.
