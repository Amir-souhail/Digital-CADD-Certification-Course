## Part Description
The **Pulley Assembly** is a mechanical system designed to transmit power or motion between components using a belt or rope. The assembly includes the following key components:

### Key Components:
1. **Pulley**: The main rotating component that guides the belt or rope.
2. **Washers**: Used to distribute load and prevent wear.
3. **Socket Head Screws**: Fasteners used to secure components.
4. **Bolts and Nuts**: Used to assemble and secure the pulley system.
5. **Other Components**: Additional parts as specified in the technical drawing.

### Key Features:
- **Section View A-A**: A detailed cross-sectional view of the pulley assembly, scaled at 2:1 for clarity.
- **Dimensions**: The drawing includes critical dimensions such as `11.5mm`, `25mm`, `65mm`, and others to ensure accurate manufacturing or 3D printing.
- **Multiple Components**: The assembly includes several parts that work together to ensure smooth operation.

### Possible Applications:
- **Power Transmission**: Used in machinery to transmit power between shafts.
- **Motion Control**: Used in systems requiring precise motion control, such as conveyor belts.
- **Mechanical Systems**: Used in various mechanical systems where rotational motion is required.
