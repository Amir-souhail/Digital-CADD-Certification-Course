# Double Bearing Assembly - CAD Project

![Double Bearing Assembly](Double_Bearing_Assembly_1.JPG)

## Description
This repository contains CAD files and technical drawings for a Double Bearing Assembly, created as part of a Digital CADD certification course. The assembly demonstrates mechanical design principles for bearing housings and precision components in metric units.

## Files Included
- **CAD Files:**
  - `*.sldprt` - SolidWorks part files
  - `*.sldasm` - SolidWorks assembly file
  - `*.step` - STEP files for cross-platform compatibility
- **Drawings:**
  - `*.pdf` - Technical drawings with dimensions and tolerances
- **Preview:**
  - `Double_Bearing_Assembly_1.JPG` - Assembly preview image

## Assembly Components

### Main Components
1. **Bearing Units (A & B)**
   - Precision radial ball bearings
   - Designed to handle both axial and radial loads
   - Contains inner/outer races and ball bearing assemblies
   - Standard 6000-series bearing dimensions

2. **Housing Base (Component 1)**
   - Primary structural component
   - Machined from aluminum alloy (or steel)
   - Features precise bore holes for bearing press-fit
   - Includes mounting flange with threaded holes

3. **Housing Cover (Component 2)**
   - Complementary to housing base
   - Contains bearing retention features
   - Alignment pins/dowels for precise assembly
   - Same material as housing base

4. **Fastening System (Components 3 & 4)**
   - **Component 3:** Cap screws (M6 or M8)
   - **Component 4:** Lock washers
   - Provides secure clamping force
   - Evenly distributed fastening pattern

## Technical Specifications
- **Units:** Millimeters (mm)
- **Tolerances:**
  - Bearing seats: H7 tolerance (+0.000/+0.018mm)
  - Standard: ¬±0.25mm
  - Critical: ¬±0.10mm
- **Materials:**
  - Housing: Aluminum 6061-T6 (or Steel AISI 1045)
  - Bearings: Chrome steel (SAE 52100)
  - Fasteners: Grade 8.8 steel
- **Surface Finish:**
  - Bearing seats: Ra 1.6Œºm
  - Other machined surfaces: Ra 3.2Œºm

## Usage Instructions
1. **Assembly Procedure:**
   - Press-fit bearings into housing base
   - Align housing cover using dowel pins
   - Secure with fasteners in criss-cross pattern
   - Torque fasteners to 12-15Nm (if specified)

2. **CAD Files:**
   - Open `.sldprt`/`.sldasm` in SolidWorks 2018+
   - `.step` files compatible with most CAD software

3. **Manufacturing Notes:**
   - Refer to PDF drawings for critical dimensions
   - All chamfers 0.5mm unless noted otherwise
   - Do not scale drawings - use provided dimensions

## Project Context
Created for Digital CADD certification demonstrating:
- 3D parametric modeling techniques
- Engineering drawing standards (ISO/ANSI)
- Mechanical assembly design
- Tolerance stack-up analysis
- Design for manufacturability
